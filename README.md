RoboPaint
=========

RoboPaint is my open-source paint program for color Palm Pilots. No,
it doesn't have robots or monkeys, but you can draw yourself some 
with it! Some of the features:

 - A saveable swatch of colors (double-tap to edit)
 - Erase (double-tap to erase full screen)
 - Copy and paste (option of white being transparent)
 - Undo (one-level)
 - Eye-dropper to select colors off the screen
 - Resizeable pen (click on up and down arrows), always a circle
 - File management (open, save, and delete)
 - Wicked cool interface (with graffitti shortcuts for all menu commands)
 - Tons of commenting (it's open-source, so I felt the need)
